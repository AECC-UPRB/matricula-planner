#Matricula Planner

Experimental app to handle selection of classes during UPRB's tuition period.

#Installation

If you know [python](https://www.python.org), you know what to do. If you don't then use [docker](https://www.docker.com).

To get started with [docker](https://www.docker.com), download & install the [docker toolbox](https://www.docker.com/toolbox) and follow the getting started guide for your operating system.

**If you are using a Linux distribuition, then follow this [guide](http://docs.docker.com/linux/started/).**

Now run the following in the project directory:

```bash
$ docker build -t matricula-planner .
$ docker run -it matricula-planner /bin/bash
$ python app.py
```

You should get a data.json file created in the same directory.

#Roadmap

I have to do one, but if you have any ideas or suggestions feel free to write an issue and we can discuss it.

Happy coding :)
